         <h1>Compared With Total Revenue and Expenditure of Massachusetts and Alabama For U.S. Education From 1992 to 2017</h1>

<div class="a">
<p>
  Education is critical to the success and future of the country. A good education can make an important contribution to the development of individuals and society. Therefore, every state in the United States takes great values to education. The state government will allocate funds to support the education of the schools, based on comprehensive considerations including different economic situations, political situations and others each year.

I made two dynamic scatter plots charts to compare data about student education in Massachusetts state and Alabama state, according to the data released by U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 2018. The x-axis represents the year of Massachusetts state or Alabama state from 1992 to 2017. The y-axis represents the total amount of revenue for Massachusetts state or Alabama state, which includes their federal revenue, state revenue and local revenue. The size of the radius of the circle represents the total expenditure for Massachusetts state or Alabama state, which includes instruction expenditure, support services expenditure, capital outlay expenditure and other expenditure. The two buttons in the top left corner can be used to view changes in total education expenditure and revenue from 1992 to 2017 in Massachusetts state and Alabama state.

As we can see, the height of circles each year in Massachusetts has always been higher than the height of circles in Alabama. The size of circles each year in Massachusetts is larger than the size of circles in Alabama as well. So, the total revenues and expenditures of education spending on students in Massachusetts both increasing faster each year than Alabama state, even though the expenditures and revenues on education in both states are growing every year.
