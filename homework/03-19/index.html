      <h5 class="w3-center">Introduction of New York State</h5>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-light-grey">New York State is a state located in the Northeastern United States, which was one of the original thirteen colonies that formed the United States. With an estimated 19.45 million residents in 2019, it is the fourth most populous state. Two-thirds of the state's population lives in the New York metropolitan area (nearly 40% on Long Island). The state and city were both named for the 17th-century Duke of York, the future King James II of England. With an estimated population of 8.39 million in 2018, the New York metropolitan area is one of the most populous in the world. New York City is a global city, home to the United Nations Headquarters, and has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, as well as the world's most economically powerful city. </p>

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-light-grey">Wildfire is defined as an uncontrolled fire spreading through natural or unnatural vegetation that often has the potential to threaten lives and property if not contained. Wildfire in New York is based on the same science and environmental factors as any wildfire in the world. Fuels, weather and topography are the primary factors that determine the natural spread and destruction of every wildfire. According to Forest Ranger Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993 through 2017, 95% of wildfires in New York are caused by humans while lightning is responsible for 5%. Debris burning accounts for 33% of all wildfires, incendiary fires account for 16%, campfires cause 16% and children are responsible for 4%. Smoking, equipment, railroads and 6miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires. </p>
